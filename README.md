# a simple visualizer of the *softmax function*

## what the heck's a softmax function?
![softmax function in LaTeX](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/5d/ql_b2bae3c8c85d9ab5e9e329fb3199d25d_l3.png)

Basically it's a function that converts an array of an arbitrary number of numbers into a probability distribution, such that the smallest number in the array will be converted to a number closest to 0, and the largest number in the array converted to a number closest to 1.

I was inspired to make this visualizer after watching this [clip of an LLM explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M&t=22m22s) made by the legendary [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown). That particular clip introduces the concept of the softmax function.
